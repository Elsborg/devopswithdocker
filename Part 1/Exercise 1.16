In exercise 1.16 I used the deveopsdockeruh/coursepage as the image. I built the very simple Dockerfile:

FROM devopsdockeruh/coursepage

Then I built the image with the command:

docker build -t coursepage .

Created a public repository on docker hub: elsborg/coursepage.

Used the following commands on the image to push it to the newly created repository on docker hub:

docker tag coursepage elsborg/coursepage

docker push elsborg/coursepage

Went with render as the cloud provider.

Clicked new webservice and chose the option deploy a existing image from a registry and entered the url to my docker repository.

The webservice url: https://coursepage-xuau.onrender.com/
